## Overview

Glamora streamlines the process of booking beauty services. The platform allows clients to:

- Filter services by rating, price range, and location.
- Select multiple services for a single booking.
- View a detailed summary of selected services, pricing, and inclusions.
- Book appointments and negotiate date and time with beauty experts.
- Make secure payments using Stripe integration.

Beauty service providers (beauty experts) can view client bookings, receive notifications for new bookings, and negotiate appointment details before confirming payment.

## Features
