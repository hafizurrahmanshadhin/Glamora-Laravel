If you have any questions about how we use your personal information or any other questions about this privacy policy, feel free to contact us, using the details set out in paragraph 10 below.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This policy explains our privacy practices in relation to how the App is used, and covers the following:</p><ul><li>Who this privacy policy applies to</li><li>What personal information is collected and used on the App</li><li>Sources of personal information</li><li>How we use your personal information</li><li>Parties who we share your personal information with</li><li>How long we retain your personal information for</li><li>Where your personal information is stored</li><li>How we legally justify using your personal information</li><li>Your legal rights in relation to your personal information</li><li>Other relevant information, including how to contact us<strong>‍</strong></li></ul><p>1. Who this privacy policy applies to</p><p>This privacy policy only relates to details that we collect and use, about people who register for and use our App (“<strong>Organisers</strong>”) and also to people who pay money to the Organiser, in relation to the App (“<strong>Contributors</strong>”).</p><p>2. What personal information is collected and used on the App<strong>‍</strong></p><p>2.1 Information that we collect</p><ul><li><strong>Registration</strong>&nbsp;- The personal information that we collect from Organisers when they initially register to use the App will only consist of the following: their name, email address, password and date of birth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Contributors –</strong>&nbsp;we receive the name and email address of a Contributor, when they make a payment onto the App via the weblink.</li><li><strong>Payments</strong>&nbsp;- When an Organiser or Contributor make payments on the App or via the weblink to the app, we also see summaries of the transactions, once they have taken place – for instance, we will see that you have paid £30 into a contribution created, and that the Organiser has withdrawn a total of £125 into a separate bank account (and we will see whose name that separate account is in e.g. the Organiser’s personal account or an account set up in the name of the contribution group itself).</li></ul><p>We may also see partial details concerning an Organiser’s and Contributor’s payment card and/or bank account but at an anonymised level (we can only see the last 4 digits) – so we will never have access to your full card details or bank account details, nor will we be able to identify you from that incomplete card number.<strong>‍</strong></p><p>2.2 Information collected and used by our third-party service providers</p><p>If you are an Organiser for a group on the App, and you wish to make a withdrawal from a contribution organised on the App, into a separate bank account, our third-party service provider may need to obtain further ID from you, as part of anti-money laundering checks. This will usually entail asking for your name, photograph on an official document which confirms your identity (e.g. a passport) and your residential address and date of birth.</p><p>We do not currently collect, nor can we access any of the following types of personal information which are likely to be used as part of the services delivered through the App:</p><ul><li>your bank account details (which are only available to the third-party payment services provider who are responsible for delivering the App payment services (Stripe Payments Europe Ltd trading as Stripe)).&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The above service providers may therefore also collect personal data about you separately from us when you use the App services. You can find out more information about what personal data the service providers collect about you and what they use it for, and how they protect it, via the following links:</p><ul><li>Stripe (who provide the payment processing services and also carry out ID verification checks for us):<a href="https://stripe.com/gb/privacy">&nbsp;https://stripe.com/gb/privacy</a></li><li>Google Cloud Platform (hosting of the App):<a href="https://cloud.google.com/security/privacy/">&nbsp;https://cloud.google.com/security/privacy/</a></li></ul><p>However, if you have any queries about how your personal information is being used on the App, including by any of the above third-party providers, please contact us in the first instance, using the details set out at paragraph 10 below – we may then refer you to the relevant third-party provider, depending on the nature of your query.<strong>‍</strong></p><p>3. Sources of personal information</p><p>Generally speaking, we only collect and use your personal information that you provide directly to us, whether this is when you register with the App, and/or when you make transactions using the App or contact us with a support query. We do not collect personal data about you from any third parties, except as follows:</p><ul><li>If you use the App in an unauthorised manner, another Organiser or Contributor may pass information to us;</li><li>If you pay money into the App using Apple pay or Google pay then we will receive your name and email address from those third parties; and</li><li>We may also receive information about Organisers from Stripe regarding anti-money laundering checks.<strong>‍</strong></li></ul><p>4. How we use your personal information</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We use your personal information in the following ways:</p><p>4.1 Organisers<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>Name, email and password</strong>&nbsp;- Registering an Organiser as a user and managing their account e.g. handling support queries.</p><p>‍<strong>Date of birth</strong>&nbsp;- Verifying that an Organiser is old enough to use the App (it is only available to users who are aged 18 and over).</p><p><strong>Transaction details and partial card number</strong>&nbsp;- Storing for audit purposes and ensuring that the App is used in a lawful and legitimate manner, in accordance with our App user terms.</p><p><strong>Name and email</strong>&nbsp;- We may also, from time to time, alert Organisers about new features of the App and similar services, by email – however, you have the right to opt out of this marketing at any time by contacting us at info@contributionspayment.com or clicking “unsubscribe” on any marketing message.</p><p><strong>ID verification information</strong>&nbsp;- For anti-money laundering checks on Organisers.<strong>‍</strong></p><p>4.2 Contributors</p><p>‍<strong>Name, email -&nbsp;</strong>Recording payments on the App, including for audit purposes.<strong>‍&nbsp;</strong>We may also, from time to time, alert Contributors about new features of the App and similar services, by email - however, you have the right to opt out of this marketing at any time by contacting us at&nbsp;info@contributionspayment.com&nbsp;or clicking “unsubscribe” on any marketing message.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Transaction details and partial card number-&nbsp;</strong>Storing for audit purposes and ensuring that the App is used in a lawful and legitimate manner.</p><p>5. Parties who we share your personal information with</p><p>We only share your personal information with the following parties, who are our third-party service providers:</p><ul><li>Stripe Payments Europe Limited trading as Stripe – who are our payment services provider and provider of identity verification for anti-money laundering compliance; and</li><li>Google Cloud Platform – who host the App.<strong>‍</strong></li></ul><p>6. How long we retain your personal information for</p><p><strong>Organisers</strong>&nbsp;- For information on anti-money laundering checks, we need to be able to access this information for 5 years, so we retain it for this period. We retain all other personal information which we collect about you for as long as you have an App account with us, plus 7 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Contributors</strong>&nbsp;– we retain information about Contributors in personally identifiable form for a period of 7 years after you have made a payment onto the App, for financial auditing purposes (following which we fully anonymise the information).</p><p>7. Where your personal information is stored</p><p>We will not transfer any of your personal information to any third-party. However, please also refer to the privacy policies of the relevant third-party providers, available via the links at paragraph 2 above. For instance, Stripe may transfer personal data to the United States and other countries outside of the United Kingdom.</p><p>8.
